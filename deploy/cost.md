## Notes

* Reflects only public pricing from Google and other providers, volume pricing requires contacting sales.
* Does not include any free tiers or monthly credit, since those resources may be consumed by other services in your account.
* All calculations are [open source on GitHub.](https://github.com/protomaps/docs/tree/main/components)
