# Basemap Downloads

## Intro

The **Protomaps Basemap** is a general purpose vector *base map* - city labels, roads, water features and other essential location context derived from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). It's available as a single PMTiles archive, distributed as an [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) Produced Work (OpenStreetMap attribution required)

## Current Version

The current version is `protomaps-basemap-opensource-20230408.pmtiles`

You can download the planet archive at this link:

[https://r2-public.protomaps.com/protomaps-sample-datasets/protomaps-basemap-opensource-20230408.pmtiles](https://r2-public.protomaps.com/protomaps-sample-datasets/protomaps-basemap-opensource-20230408.pmtiles)

Please note that this **URL may change** and hotlinking to it is discouraged. Instead, you should copy the tileset to your own [Cloud Storage](/pmtiles/cloud-storage).
